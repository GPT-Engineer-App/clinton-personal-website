# clinton-personal-website

Create a basic personal website template with the following:

- A header with a placeholder for a profile image and name
- An "About Me" section with placeholder text 
- A "Projects" or "Portfolio" section with space to add featured work
- A "Contact" section with social media links and a contact form
- A simple, professional design 

Use fictional information as placeholders for now, to be replaced with DeWitt Clinton's actual details later.
